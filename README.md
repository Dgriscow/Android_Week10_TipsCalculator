# Android_Week10_TipsCalculator
This is a "Dynamic" Tipping App. 
Rather than the user pressing a button to input tip amount, whatever action the user would think would calculate a tip does. 
After typing it calculates based off current selected. If the user changes tip type it re calculates, unless its empty.
Also formats to "x.xx" dollar format.
